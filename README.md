# alteryx_lineage_viewer
This is a self-contained, collaborative web tool designed to parse Alteryx workflow files (.yxmd) and build an interactive data lineage map. It allows a team to visualize all workflow inputs and outputs, see the relationships between them, and understand data dependencies across multiple processes.
